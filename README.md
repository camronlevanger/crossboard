# crossboard

This project is in the very earliest stages of research. It is also based on a
crossbar.io API that will be completely changing in the future. I have every
intention of keeping this up-to-date with any crossbar.io changes, but do keep
these things in mind before deciding to use this project in any critical capacity.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

Example:

`http://localhost:9000/#/?protocol=ws&url=localhost&port=9999&sub=&realm=realm1`

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
